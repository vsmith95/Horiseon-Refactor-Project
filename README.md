# Finished Refactoring Project - Vaughn Smith
In this project I was required to refactor the code of an existing webpage and update it to best practice. I found a number of <div> elements in the HTML that needed to be updated to things such as header, footer and section. As well, there was a large amound of reused rulings in the CSS that needed to be consolidated into single rulings applying to multiple sections to show understanding of DRY. 

I ran into a few snafu's early on in the project getting it connected with github but I had a TA's assistance in resolving that, though it did cost me losing a few commit messages, which is why my count on them will be a little lower than I would have liked. 

I ran into a couple situations where I had broken the webpage in drastic ways which took me some time to resolve but was a lot of fun to figure out the little puzzles I would make for myself along the way!
